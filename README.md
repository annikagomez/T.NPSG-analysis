# T.NPSG-analysis
Code and data used to perform analysis and generate figures in "A globally distributed phage-plasmid infects marine N2-fixing cyanobacterium Trichodesmium". 

# Repository contents
- `fig_1_genome_vizualization.ipynb`: Code to process phage-plasmid genome annotations, create files needed for NCBI GenBank deposit, and generate Figure 1a and Supplementary Figures 2 and 3.
- `fig_1_orthogroup_vizualization.ipynb`: Code to process OrthoFinder output and generate Figure 1b.
- `fig_2_metaT.ipynb`: Code to process metatranscriptome mapping, assembly gene annotations, and DESeq results and generate Figures 2a and 2b and Supplementary Figures 4 and 5.
- `fig_3_methylation.ipynb`: Code to process MicrobeMod output and generate Figures 3a and 3b and Supplementary Figure 6.
- `fig_4_metagenome_mapping.ipynb`: Code to process mapping results from global metagenomes and generate Figure 4a and Supplementary Figures 7 and 8.
- `fig_4_model_output.ipynb`: Code to generate Figure 4b.
